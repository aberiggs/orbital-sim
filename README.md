# physics-sim
A collection of physics simulations developed from scratch with **C++** and **OpenGL**.

## Building
Building currently only supported on Mac and Linux and you must have `glfw` installed.

From the root of the repository, do the following:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
From this, binaries will be created and stored in `build/bin`.
